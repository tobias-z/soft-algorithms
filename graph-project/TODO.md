# To do

- [] Data
  - [x] create structure in relational database that can be used for a graph
  - [x] create database with data
  - [x] load data from database into a usable model
  - [] document the data we use and the process of creating the data
- [] Map implementation
  - [x] street map / indoor map. We can prob find some way to make this into one algorithm
  - [x] Dijkstra's algorithm
  - [x] depth-first search. Where can this be used?
  - [] Comments on the algorithms
- [] Documentation
  - [] document the application in general
  - [] design documents (dev env, architecture, etc.)
  - [] clear comprehensive explanation of the algorithms used
- [] Presentation - 10 minutes
  - [] demonstration of the applications' functionality
  - [] discussion of the algorithms used
  - [] overview of the performance (prob things like space and time complexity)
